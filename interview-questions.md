# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props in React refer to properties. Props are passed down from the parent component to the child component and since they are read-only, props are not able to be changed.

  Researched answer: Components and props go hand in hand with each other. Conceptually, components are similar to functions in JavaScript. Components accept inputs, also known as "props", and ultimately return React elements. Props allow the user to send data from one component to another.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event refers to any visual change that occurs on the Document Object Model on a webpage or application. These changes may include hovering over specific areas, clicking on links, typing inputs, etc.

  Researched answer: Anything involving user interaction whether it may be a mouse click, hovering over elements, or typing with a keyboard, are all considered events within the Document Object Model. The DOM is always looking out for changes so as developers, there are certain event listeners that are added to HTML and JSX tags that will wait for events to happen. One example of these event listeners is the onClick function which will execute a particular action that is coded by the developer, once that specific node is clicked on by the user.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming, also known as OOP, is the practice of programming by mainly utilizing objects rather than functions or logic. OOP is reinforced by the philosophy that human beings are naturally more inclined to think of their everyday surroundings as objects and therefore makes it easier to adopt this style of programming. OOP is different from functional programming in the sense that OOP is based on the concept of objects whereas functional programming is more revolved around functions.

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is the practice of programming that relies on the concept of classes and objects. OOP is mainly utilized to structure reusable blueprints of code, which are often known as classes, and these blueprints are then used to create objects. On the other hand, functional programming is the programming practice that relies solely on pure functions and these functions will take in parameter(s) and return an expected output based on how the function is coded.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: The difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby is that an Integers are identified as only whole numbers (1,2,3, etc.) whereas Floats are identified as numbers with decimals (1.5, 2.7, 3.89, etc.). If one were to run the mathematical expression 5/2 in a ruby file, the output would be 2. However, if the expression was rewritten to be 5.0/2, the output would be 2.5 which is the correct answer.

  Researched answer: A float or floating-point number in Ruby represents a real number. Real numbers are defined as both rational and irrational numbers. In other words, floats are just integers with a decimal point. If there are no decimal places on a number in a Ruby file, then that specific number will be considered as an integer.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: The implicit return of Ruby refers to the idea that unlike JavaScript, Ruby functions do not require the 'return' statement and is already implied within the Ruby language. Therefore, when writing out functions in Ruby, the user is not required to write out 'return' by the end of the function.

  Researched answer: Every code block in Ruby is designed in a way so that the value of the last line will be returned automatically without needing the 'return' to be typed. This is a feature in Ruby that helps enhance the simplicity of the language and making sure that minimal code is written.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: The variables that are defined prefixed by the @ symbol.

2. PostgreSQL: SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used for communicating with relational databases. Postgres is an open source object-relational database management system, which means Postgres looks at databases through an object-oriented programming (OOP) lens.

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby.

4. ORM: ORM is Object Relational Mapper. A programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages.

5. Active Record: Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic.
